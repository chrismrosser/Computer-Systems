### 1.1 Information is bits + context
  
  All information in a system is represented as a bunch of bits. Programmers need to learn how a system is read and translated by a program. Everything can be understood in this order;
  - Bits = 0 or 1s
  - Bytes = 8-bit characters
  - Text Characters translate to to ASCII 
  - ASCII is a common standard that represents each character with a unque *byte sized* interger value.   
### 1.2 Programs are translated by other programs into different forms  
  
  Quick look at the **compilation system**  
  - A system of phases that take human text and convert it into readable binary to create an excutable program.  
    - Preprocessing phase
    - Compilation phase
    - Assembly phase
    - Linking phase   
  
This is the process by which human code gets brought into a compiler into binary then into a executable object - useable program.
